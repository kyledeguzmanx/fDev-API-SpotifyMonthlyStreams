## HOW TO USE

The API is currently available in the [RAPID API Marketplace](https://rapidapi.com/user/kyledeguzmanx). Find all my APIs on my profile on RapidAPI [@kyledeguzmanx](https://rapidapi.com/user/kyledeguzmanx)   


In order to use the API, you must sign in to the Rapid API platform. 


After signing in, return to the API page. At the top right of the middle coulumn, you will need to subscribe to this API to get your own unique API Key. The free subscription offers unlimited uses. (Note: If you're publishing the source code of your project, make sure you always hide your API Keys)   

Once you get your API Key, you can now use the API.   

The path to fetch the API is:  



and add your unique API key at the end.  

Also, if you're viewing the API Documentation page, in the right-most column, there are code snippets (in various languages and techniques) that show you how to fetch the API. For example, with NodeJS, you can use the axios module or the node-fetch module. Or if you're using Javascript, you can use XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, or jQuery.   

Note: Keep your API Keys private and off your GitHub. For more information, check out this article I love [How to Hide API Key in GitHub Repo](https://dev.to/ptprashanttripathi/how-to-hide-api-key-in-github-repo-2ik9) by [Pt. Prashant tripathi](https://github.com/PtPrashantTripathi)
